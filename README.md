Average leve is 50% × Black Sole XP(+100% if preferred world) × 3 + 50% × other XP(+100% if preferred world)

50% × 206492 × 200% × 3 + 50% × 344153 × 200% = 963629

XP from 30 to 90 is 150168400

150168400/963629=155.8363229 leves

So you'll need 156 leves, 2 rounds of turnin

156 Ash Tuna, 78 Indigo Herring, 702 Black Sole per alt; 6240, 3120 and 28080 per 40 alts.

Since 1/6th of the time you can choose between Tuna and Herring you can shift Tuna/Herring from 25:25 to 33:17 if you so choose.

This is good cause Tuna can be gathered faster with retainers, so make you AR venture plan like so.
