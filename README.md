Average leve is 50% * Black Sole XP(+100% if preferred world) * 3 + 50% * other XP(+100% if preferred world)
50%*206492*200%*3+50%*344153*200%=963629
XP from 30 to 90 is 150168400
150168400/963629=155.8363229 leves
So you'll need 156 leves, 2 rounds of turnin
117 Ash Tuna, 117 Indigo Herring, 702 Black Sole per alt; 4680, 4680 and 28080 per 40 alts.
