# Getting started

## Introduction
The process of making retainers has a lot of components. It'll take months, but it'll set you up for life. Don't think too much about time or try to get it perfect the first time. I made this with help from many others so that you can have an easier time than we did. Just do what you can and if you change your mind, you can always level a new class or start over on a different server knowing that it'll be easier after the first. If it helps, do a test toon before you do 40, you'll learn a lot.

## Roadmap
- Figure out your goals: This is one of the most important tasks of them all. Do you want submersibles too? Choose your server and classes accordingly.
- Make toons: you can only do 8 per day so it's good to get it done early
- Level to 50 with Questionable and Questionable Companion
- Make retainers with Henchman
- Level retainer job to 100, more on this later.
- Unlock GC rank 9 with AutoHunt and [insert future script/plugin for GC rankup]

## Resources
[Punish plugins](https://discord.com/channels/1001823907193552978/1272173416933494875): AutoRetainer, SomethingNeedDoing, Lifestream, and more. They'll be mentioned as needed. 

[F.U.T.A.](https://github.com/Jaksuhn/SomethingNeedDoing/tree/master/Community%20Scripts/AutoRetainer%20Companions/AutoMaintenance) retainer manager, levels FSH via ocean fishing, does turnin

[Wiggly/Friendly scripts](https://github.com/WigglyMuffin/SNDScripts/tree/main/Scripts/)
 - Character Cycler: Cycles characters before AutoRetainer can do it
 - Overseer: retainer/sub manager, uses gc missions to level any DoL and trades mats between accounts to do so.
 - Questionable Companion: for nearly all issues that stop Questionable from completing an alt
 - AutoHunt: does your (GC) hunt log to unlock the needed GC rank

## Which class should I level?

## Setup

Plugins: Dalamud Plugin Installer - Settings - Experimental - scroll down - Custom plugin repositories. Add the repo links to a new line, press plus, click save. Then install the plugin from the installer.
Extra for SND (SomethingNeedDoing): While you're there, you'll need to enable testing builds

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdaac55c-a7cd-4238-bba1-908cc1669568)

Once you have SND installed, right click, get the testing version 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/274dba6c-0f55-4b59-8689-8f48311b71f7)

Scripts: These will tell you usually in both the script itself and on the github page what they need. Read the requirements and don't forget to set the settings within the script. 
For setting config folder for AutoHunt: Open SND. Click help, click options on the help window.

You can also set a script to run after AR under AutoRetainer.

## Fisher

Fisher is faster, or cheaper than any other class to do. The downside is that it has basically no use outside of quick ventures. If you have no subs and don't care too much this is probably your class.

### 1-30

You unlock FSH in Limsa, do your class quests till you unlock ocean fishing, then start with the Limsa leves. I'll need to check how ChilledLeves works to say what's best to get to 30, but it's gonna be some combination of leves. 

### 30-90: Costa Leves
For the main bulk of levelling, the best way is to get fish with retainers and use them for Costa Del Sol leves.
3/4 fish can be gathered with retainers. Prioritise Black Sole in ChilledLeves
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/628bb8a2-3def-4809-abaf-33a1511685fb)
Average leve is 50% × Black Sole XP(+100% if preferred world) × 3 + 50% × other XP(+100% if preferred world)

50% × 206492 × 200% × 3 + 50% × 344153 × 200% = 963629

XP from 30 to 90 is 150168400

150168400 / 963629 = 155.8363229 leves

So you'll need 156 leves, 2 rounds of turnin

156 Ash Tuna, 78 Indigo Herring, 702 Black Sole per alt; 6240, 3120 and 28080 per 40 alts.

Since 1/6th of the time you can choose between Tuna and Herring you can shift Tuna/Herring from 25:25 to 33:17 if you so choose.

This is good cause Tuna can be gathered faster with retainers, so make you AR venture plan like so.

### Any level: Ocean Fishing

If for some reason leves are no longer viable for you, either cause you've hit 90, don't have fish or gil to buy it, or anything else, ocean fishing is a good way to level.
Every 2 hours you can do it for 22 min, use F.U.T.A or some other script to start it when it's up and fish with AutoHook from puni.sh using the presets. The downside is it's only every 2 hours, so solely relying on this for levelling will add about day per toon until you're done, but it is completely afk at least.

## Combat

### Miscellanious

#### How many Ocean Fishing boats from 1-100?
 
Strongly recommended to go on boats at 80+ or even 90 while using costa leves from fish from retainers. But if you can't find/make the fish needed, here's how I'd do it.
With preferred world bonus, I did it with about 20-26 total leves (to ~lvl 45) plus 18ish boats. Without leves its about 23 boats.
Starting limsa leves till level 20 using fish bought from vendor (Lominsan Anchovy, finger shrimp and coral butterfly).
Quarrymill leves to lvl 45-50 (or 30 with Costa leves) (all but black ghost are usually ok price).
Then ocean fish to 100. Things that help - in order of importance - cordials, rng, gp from gear, food.
A typical result without anything looks like  1 - 11 - 21 - 31 - 39 - 45 - 50 - 55 - 59 - 63 - 67 - 70 - 73 - 76 - 79 - 82 - 85 - 88 - 90 - 92 - 94 - 96 - 98 - 100

#### Info on rankings
Based on my toons with 9 retainers you cap out on ~1.2m seals/week or 5.2m /month. That lands you around 10th place for gc ranking on low pop OCE servers, and only lower anywhere else.

#### Numbers and stuff:

Gil per quick venture (7.25):
SE decided OC should give you old expensive items :'( This means while ppl are farming that, the price of dyes went down by 30-50%. You can still sell them if you want or hold onto your venture coffers until the price goes back up.

720 = 1200 x 0.6 from seals
1745 = 3% x 9.7% x 2 x 300k from dyes
2465/qv or 1.80m/month

If you wanna spend time selling fc points, they are worth 1-2 gil via **cereleum tank**. you can get 2 depending on buyer, but for simplicity, let's say 1. Don't buy anything else with them to sell, there's no market.
529 = 529 x 1 fc points
2994/qv or 2.19m/month

Gil per quick venture (7.2):
720 = 1200 x 0.6 from seals
2910 = 3% x 9.7% x 2 x 500k from dyes
3630/qv or 2.65m/month

If you wanna spend time selling fc points, they are worth 1-2 gil via cereleum tank. you can get 2 depending on buyer, but for simplicity, let's say 1. Don't buy anything else with them to sell, there's no market.
529 = 529 x 1 fc points
4159/qv or 3.04m/month

On top of this you will also get items to sell, most of which are going to be vendored, because it's a hassle to sell manually. Just add anything worth less than 20k-50k to your AR sell list.

Speed:
Your handling time will depend on a bunch of factors: login queue, AR settings and enabled features, ping, fps. But ballpark figures for me on an old pc are: 
Relog: avg. 55 seconds (40-80 s), retainer: avg. 7.5 s, or 70 s total for 2 retainers. Turnin takes 1.16 s/retainer, more on this below. So with a 40x2 army you should complete a cycle in less than 48 minutes (40* (55 +2 * (7.5+1.16))/60) which means your retainers are fully efficient and can fit more into an hour.

If you're slower than these numbers, minimise your game and try to raise fps, disable plugins.

Turnin: Again, depends, so ballpark. With proper inventory management (ie. AR unconditional sell list and periodic cleaning) you need turnin after about 750 qv (inventory + armory is 530 slots, some used for stuff to be sold makes it ~500, with ~66% of getting turnin gear, that'll fill in 750 qv). Turnin takes about 15 min, that's 1.16 s (15 x 60/750) for each qv. With only 2 retainers you should need it every 15.6 days (750/2/24). With more retainers, it's more frequent, but even with 10 total retainers it'll be an extra 11.6 s which is ~9% of the expected runtime of 130 s (55+10 x 7.5).
There's actually a reason to do it more frequently, since items from last patch have a higher chance of dropping, which are worth more seals. I don't know the maths on this, and I don't think it's really worth digging into, but there may be merit to doing turnin more frequently, like right after your armoury is full. It won't eat into your efficiency.
